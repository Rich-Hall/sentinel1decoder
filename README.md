# sentinel1decoder
Python decoder for Sentinel-1 level0 files. The level0 format consists of the raw space packets downlinked from the Sentinel-1 spacecraft. This package decodes these and produces the raw I/Q sensor output from the SAR instrument, which can then be firther processed to focus a SAR image.

This code is heavily based on an implementation in C by jmfriedt which can be found at: https://github.com/jmfriedt/sentinel1_level0
